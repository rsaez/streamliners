## Setting up Ruby on Rails on Windows

This is assuming you have no version of ruby or rails installed in your system. If you need multiple versions you need to use RVM. This is for a single version of Ruby.
 
1. Download and install Ruby 2 from (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
 
2. Download the corresponding development kit and extract it in a directory say "RubyDevKit" from (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
 
3. In command prompt, change directory to RubyDevKit and type the command "ruby dk.rb init" 
 
4. Type the command "ruby dk.rb install"
 
5. Type "gem install rails"
 
For more detailed info about installing Development Kit (for multiple versions), go here (https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)
